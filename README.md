## Yelp clone

This repository is the main repo for the app discussed and built in great detail at the [fullstackreact /blog](https://fullstackreact.com/blog). For an in-depth discussion, check out the post.

## Getting yelp up and running

Getting the app up and running is straight-forward. Clone the repo, install the dependencies, and run the start script.

### Cloning the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fullstackio/yelp-clone.git yelp
$ cd yelp
```

### Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Configuring the application

This app uses [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) for configuration. In order to configure the application for your own api access, grab an api token from google at [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) and set it in a file called `.env` at the root for a key called `__GAPI_KEY__`.
For instance, say that your gapi key is: `abc123`. Your `.env` file should look like:

```bash
GAPI_KEY=abc123
```

You can also create this file by copying the `.env.example` file at the root:

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

### Starting the application

```bash
$ npm start
```

This app uses the following technologies:

* [webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
* [postcss](http://postcss.org)
* [hjs-webpack](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/hjs-webpack)
* [react.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/)

* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
* [google-maps-react npm](https://github.com/fullstackreact/google-maps-react)
* [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
* [chai](http://chaijs.com)
* And much much more

### Running the tests

The application is built using tests, including the fantastic [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and [chai](http://chaijs.com) libraries. To run the tests, use the `npm` test script:

```shell
npm run test
```
